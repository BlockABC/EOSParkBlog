# Alfred + EOSpark, the most efficient way to check EOS blockchain informations

Hi guys!  This is Tim from EOSpark. Alfred is my favorite product which makes great improvement in the efficiency of our daily work. And EOSpark is a powerful EOS block explorer proudly operated by us. We reorganized the data on EOS chain to clearly display everything happened on EOS.



How to make our users get EOS related informations in the fastest way is a proposition that we have been thinking about. Therefore, we tried to combine Alfred and EOSPark together, and we luanched an Alfred extension to help our users checking EOS informations in a better efficient way.
